We need much more detail to generate useful data. You've stated you want the AI to be an engineer, which is a good starting point, but we need to be more specific. For example, a *data engineer* would be more appropriate for a data generation task than a *mechanical engineer*. However, before we delve into the persona, we first need to understand *what kind* of data you need. This will heavily influence the persona, format, and other aspects. **Question 1:** What type of data are you trying to generate? (e.g., social network data, event data, time series data, prediction data, etc.) Knowing this will help us define the appropriate data schema and the AI's persona.",gemini-1.5-flash,2.09,

2025-07-21 12:55:42,me@saqr.me,Prompt Engineering,AI,3,"Okay, let's refine your prompt! ""I want to create data for my assignment"" is a great starting point, but it's quite broad. To help the AI understand what you need, we need more detail. The first thing missing is the *Persona*. **Question 1:** Who should the AI be acting as to best generate this data? Would a data scientist, database administrator, simulation specialist, or someone else be most appropriate for your needs? Thinking about this will help us define the level of detail and sophistication of the generated data. For example, a data scientist might focus on realistic distributions and statistical properties, while a database administrator might prioritize data integrity and schema design.",gemini-1.5-flash,1.38,

To help the AI understand what you need, we need to add much more detail. First, what *kind* of data do you want to create? (e.g., social network data, event data, time series data, data for a machine learning model, etc.) This will significantly impact how we structure the rest of the prompt. Knowing the data type will help us define the appropriate format and schema.",gemini-1.5-flash,1.36,

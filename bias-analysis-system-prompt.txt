1. **Gender Bias**: Examine pronoun usage and gender-related assumptions
2. **Cultural/Nationality Bias**: Look for stereotypes or cultural assumptions
3. **Academic Field Stereotypes**: Check for field-specific biases or expectations
4. **Performance Assumptions**: Analyze how student progress is characterized
5. **Support Strategy Bias**: Evaluate if support methods align with student characteristics
6. **Outcome Bias**: Examine if results match expectations based on demographics

Provide:
- Specific bias indicators found
- Potential impact of identified biases
- Recommendations for more neutral language or approaches
- Overall bias risk assessment (Low/Medium/High)

Be thorough but concise in your analysis.

Summary:** This study analyzed data from 200 undergraduate students in online mathematics courses to identify behavioral patterns differentiating high and low achievers. Results reveal strong correlations between online engagement (login frequency, assignment completion, discussion participation, and study time) and academic performance (GPA). A predictive model, achieving 87.5% cross-validation accuracy, was developed using these engagement factors. **2. Statistical Interpretation:** * **Descriptive Statistics:** High achievers exhibited significantly higher means for all engagement variables compared to low achievers. The larger standard deviations for low achievers in assignment completion and study time suggest greater variability in their engagement patterns. * **Inferential Statistics (t-tests):** All t-tests comparing high and low achievers on engagement variables yielded highly significant p-values (< 0.001), indicating statistically significant differences. Large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.45) demonstrate substantial practical significance, meaning the differences observed are not only statistically reliable but also meaningfully large in magnitude. The confidence intervals further reinforce the reliability of these findings. * **Correlation Analysis:** Strong positive correlations (r > 0.58) were found between GPA and all engagement variables, indicating a consistent relationship where greater engagement is associated with higher academic performance. The highest correlation was observed between GPA and assignment completion (r = 0.78). * **Multiple Regression:** The multiple regression model explained 82% of the variance in GPA (R² = 0.82), demonstrating a strong predictive power. All predictor variables (assignment completion, discussion participation, login frequency, and study time) were statistically significant (p < 0.001), with assignment completion showing the strongest predictive effect (β = 0.45). The model's high cross-validation accuracy (87.5%), sensitivity (89.2%), and specificity (85.8%) suggest good generalizability and robustness. **3. Educational Significance:** The findings highlight the crucial role of active engagement in online learning environments. Students who actively participate, consistently complete assignments, engage in discussions, and dedicate sufficient study time achieve significantly better academic outcomes. This underscores the importance of shifting from a passive to an active learning paradigm in online education. **4. Practical Implications:** * **Early Intervention:** The predictive model allows for the early identification of at-risk students based on their online engagement patterns. This enables timely interventions, such as personalized support, targeted tutoring, or additional learning resources. * **Curriculum Design:** The strong predictive power of assignment completion suggests that the design and delivery of online assignments should be carefully considered.

Summary:** This study analyzed data from 200 undergraduate students in online mathematics courses to identify behavioral patterns distinguishing high and low achievers and develop a predictive model for early intervention. The results reveal strong correlations between online engagement (login frequency, assignment completion, discussion participation, study time) and academic performance (GPA). A multiple regression model accurately predicts student success based on these engagement factors, particularly assignment completion. **2. Statistical Interpretation:** Descriptive statistics show significant differences between high and low achievers in all engagement metrics. Independent samples t-tests confirmed these differences are statistically significant (all p < 0.001) with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen's d ranging from 1.45 to 2.78). This indicates substantial practical significance, meaning the observed differences are not only statistically unlikely to be due to chance but also represent meaningful differences in behavior. The 95% confidence intervals provide a range within which the true population difference likely lies. Correlation analysis demonstrated strong positive correlations between GPA and all engagement metrics (r values ranging from 0.58 to 0.78, all p < 0.001). The multiple regression model (R² = 0.82, Adjusted R² = 0.81, F(4,195) = 89.45, p < 0.001) explains 81% of the variance in GPA, with assignment completion being the strongest predictor (β = 0.45).

Summary:** This study analyzed data from 200 undergraduate students in online mathematics courses to identify behavioral patterns distinguishing high and low achievers and develop a predictive model for early intervention. Results reveal strong correlations between online engagement (login frequency, assignment completion, discussion participation, study time) and academic performance (GPA). A multiple regression model, achieving 87.5% cross-validation accuracy, successfully predicts student performance based on these engagement factors. **2. Statistical Interpretation:** Descriptive statistics show clear differences between high and low achievers across all engagement metrics. High achievers exhibited significantly higher means for login frequency, assignment completion, discussion participation, and study time. Independent samples t-tests confirmed these differences are statistically significant (p < 0.001 for all) with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen's d ranging from 1.45 to 2.78). This indicates substantial practical significance beyond statistical significance; the differences observed are not merely due to chance but represent meaningful variations in behavior. Correlation analysis showed strong positive correlations between GPA and all four engagement variables (r values ranging from 0.58 to 0.78, all p < 0.001). The multiple regression model yielded a high R² (0.82), indicating that the four predictor variables (assignment completion, discussion participation, login frequency, study time) explain 82% of the variance in GPA. The model's significant F-statistic (p < 0.001) and high cross-validation accuracy further support its robustness. The individual predictor variables all showed statistically significant positive relationships with GPA (all p < 0.001). The confidence intervals around the means and regression coefficients provide a range of plausible values for these effects. **3. Educational Significance:** The findings highlight the crucial role of active online engagement in student success within online learning environments. The strong predictive power of the model suggests that early intervention strategies focusing on these engagement factors could significantly improve student outcomes. This reinforces the importance of moving beyond simply providing content and towards fostering active learning and participation. **4. Practical Implications:** * **Early Warning System:** Regular monitoring of login frequency can identify at-risk students early in the course, allowing for timely intervention. * **Targeted Support:** Students with low assignment completion rates should receive prioritized support, perhaps through personalized feedback, tutoring, or improved learning materials. * **Community Building:** Incentivizing discussion participation can foster a sense of community and enhance learning through peer interaction. This could involve grading rubrics, structured discussions, or peer feedback mechanisms. * **Study S","gemini-1.5-flash","7493","research_context:Study comparing high and low achievers in online learning environments.
